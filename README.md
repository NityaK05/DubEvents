# DubEvents1
An app for discovering and attending social events at the University of Washington. With features like Tinder-style swiping, calendar mode, personalized event recommendations, and calendar integration, users can easily browse, save, and share events with friends while filtering by location and interests.

## Features
- **Home Page**: Browse and swipe through events.
- **Calendar Page**: View events added to your UW Google Calendar.
- **Profile Page**: Set up your profile with your UW email, including name, major, graduation year, interests, living situation, and cultural/social background. First-time users are guided through a slide-show format setup, ensuring all profile details are collected interactively.
- **Login Requirement**: Users must log in with their University of Washington email to access the app.
- **Navigation Drawer**: Easily switch between pages.

##Inspiration
We often found ourselves missing out on events and having a hard time keeping up with all of the events at the University of Washington as students here. From social events and parties to clubs, workshops, and dorm hall-specific gatherings, there are numerous events to keep track of. With a campus as active and diverse as UW, we wanted to create something that would simplify discovering and attending events in a way that feels intuitive, personal, and social. We created DubEvents, a mobile application that enables students to easily browse, save, and RSVP for events in a fun, swipe-based format, making it effortless to stay connected with everything happening on campus.

##What it does
DubEvents is a sleek, mobile-based platform that helps UW students discover social events through an engaging Tinder-style interface. Users swipe through events to quickly decide whether to attend, with a Right motion meaning Yes, and a Left motion meaning No. Once the user swipes right on an event, it is added to their calendar. Users can also click on the events to read more about them. All of this is saved to the user’s profile, along with their personal information. This helps UW students stay aware of events around campus and organize their event attendance in a less overwhelming way.

##How we built it
We developed DubEvents on Android Studio, using Java and XML as our primary programming languages; our application can currently be run on Android devices. The swiping functionality uses a card stack implementation for the events. The design was inspired by the UW color palette: dark purple, white, black, and tan/sandalwood colors. We drew out the UI layout and framework by hand before implementing the XML pages, focusing on a minimal design.

##Challenges we ran into
Challenges we encountered included working with Git and GitHub, as multiple members made changes simultaneously. Some of us were new to Git, so it was challenging to navigate and learn how to use these new tools effectively. We struggled with learning how to commit and branch off the same repository, and kept running into push/pull issues. We were also working with Android Studio for the first time and learning the interface of this new platform. We didn’t fully understand how it worked, and ended up working in Kotlin, a language that none of us were familiar with, for a while. Integrating swiping with calendar functionality while ensuring that data about the events is correctly stored was another challenge. The more pages we wanted to include in our design, the more complicated it became and the more detail we had to handle. Therefore, we had to figure out how to ensure that the same Saved Events appeared in the calendar and disappeared from the main page, regardless of how many times the pages were reopened. Designing a clean yet expressive interface that matched the University of Washington's branding while remaining unique was also challenging. We wanted to stay connected to the color system of the University, but it was a bit confusing to connect it to the colors in the app. Lastly, we had to deal with conflicts within the team regarding planning and executing different ideas, as well as splitting our time efficiently. It was a bit challenging to find unique tasks for all four of our team members to work on, and sometimes we ended up having two people working on the same thing without realizing it.

##Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are proud of thinking of this unique and beneficial application idea for students. We wanted to come up with an idea that would be impactful, and we are glad that we developed an idea that we can eventually introduce to our community. Coming up with this app idea and implementing a base product, or minimum viable product (MVP), was a significant step. In the time constraint that we were given for this hackathon, we got a lot done, and it has a lot of the features that we originally planned on including. For most of us, this was our first time using some of the tools and resources we used to build this application, like Android Studio and GitHub. We really learned a lot about git and how the branching system worked, and by the end we were all able to work on the same project side by side, something that we were struggling with at the beginning. We also learned how to use Android Studio effectively and explored various tools it provides, such as Copilot for coding. We built a working swipe-to-save events application that can perform the operations of a minimum viable product. We were able to create not only an app that responds to clicking on the object, but also one that performs different actions depending on the direction it is dragged into. We also designed a beautiful and cohesive user interface that aligns with our theme. We are really glad to see how the layout of all the pages line up nicely, and how there is a visible connection between them all.

##What we learned
Throughout this process, we learned how to design intuitive user flows for multiple browsing modes. We struggled to determine which system we wanted to cater to. Most of us work on Apple projects, but they aren’t compatible with those who have Android devices. That is why we centered on Android Studio, because we would be able to work on both Android and iOS. We also collaborated on a project together, from brainstorming the idea to turning it into a real prototype, and addressed conflicts, such as team arguments. This is something that every group faces, but we were able to communicate well, and I think our teamwork shone throughout this process. Another central growth area for all of us was exploring the various features of GitHub, particularly those related to merging branches and resolving merge conflicts. We had to do a lot of trial and error with GitHub, especially in the beginning. Our first couple of repositories became quite messy as we struggled to figure out how to work together and utilize all the collaboration features. At one point, we even had to scrap everything and start fresh… twice. Eventually, we began to get the hang of branching and merging, which made things a lot smoother. That said, we're definitely still learning, and even now our repo could be way more organized. But we’ve come a long way from where we started! We also learned the importance of branding and visual consistency in campus-focused apps. We created a logo that we could place on almost every page, and found that it adds a level of professionalism that lends more credibility to the app and can gain a deeper level of trust from users.


##What's next for DubEvents
We’re really excited about what’s next for our app. One of the biggest things we’re working on is UW NetID sign-in, so we can make sure everyone using the app is either a current student or part of a registered student org. It’s a small step, but it helps keep the community authentic and UW-focused.

Currently, we manually pull event information, but moving forward, we aim to provide clubs and organizations with the ability to post their events directly. That way, they can keep their members in the loop, and students can more easily find events that match their interests - particularly ones related to their major.

Personalization is another big piece of our vision. We want the app to recommend events based on your major, your interests, your background, and even where you live - whether it’s North Campus, West Campus, or off-campus. We plan to utilize AI to refine these suggestions over time.

We’re also planning to expand beyond Android by launching iOS and a web version, so students can access the app in whichever way works best for them. As we grow, we would love to collaborate with UW departments to showcase academic and career events and gather genuine feedback from students to help shape the app into something that genuinely works for the community.

At the end of the day, our goal is to build something that makes it easier for students to connect - with events, with opportunities, and with each other.
